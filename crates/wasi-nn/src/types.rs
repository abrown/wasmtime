//! The `wasi-nn` types used internally in this crate.
//!
//! These types form a common "ground truth" for the `witx` and `wit` ABI types
//! to be converted from and to. As such, these types should be kept up to date
//! with the WIT and WITX specifications; if anything changes in the
//! specifications, we should see compile errors in the conversion functions
//! (e.g., `impl From<witx::...> for `crate::...`).
